# jekyll-podcast-import-script

A PHP script that will create Jekyll posts (YAML &amp; Markdown) from an iTunes podcast feed.

## Usage

1. (Optional) Modify `import_podcast.php` to suit your needs. Specifically, you may want to edit the `writePost()` funciton.
2. Run `import_podcast.php feed.xml` on an iTunes XML feed file. This will create a `_posts` directory with Jekyll posts in it.
